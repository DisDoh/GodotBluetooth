**WaveTrigger** 

FPGA-based Multi-Effects system for the electric guitar. This project uses GodotBluetooth and Godot Engine for an Android application who changes in real-time the effects designed on a FPGA Altera Cyclone II.

The project it's designed to work with a guitar input in the Line-in port, and an amplifier in the Line-out.
The effects created are: Distortion and Tremolo.
